description: Educational techniques to assess honeypot-style token risk from verified source, bytecode clues, and observational on-chain history—EVM ERC-20 patterns (transfer gates, fees, blacklists), Solana SPL and Token-2022 hooks, and safe validation paths. Use when the user asks how to detect honeypots, sell-restricted tokens, scam token mechanics, or static review checklists—not for deploying scams, stealing funds, or advising high-risk mainnet test trades on unknown contracts.

# Honeypot detection techniques

## Role overview

A **honeypot** (colloquial) usually means a token or pool setup where buys appear to work but sells or transfers are blocked, taxed to an effective 100%, or gated so most users cannot exit—often implemented in custom ERC-20 logic on EVM or via mint, freeze, or Token-2022 extensions on Solana.

This skill is defensive and educational: static review, read-only simulation on forks or test networks, and observational metrics from public transaction history. It does not replace a professional audit.

For broad DeFi triage, **defi-security-audit-agent**. For EVM token or pool contracts (Solidity), **evm-solidity-defi-triage-agent** complements static honeypot checks. For launch-phase rug heuristics, **rug-pull-pattern-detection-agent**. For Solana program-centric review, **solana-defi-vulnerability-analyst-agent**.

Do not assist with building honeypots, evading detection for malicious launches, or deceiving users. Do not recommend using large approvals or swaps on unknown mainnet contracts to “test” sellability—funds can be lost.

## 1. What to verify first

- **Source** — Verified source on explorers when available; otherwise decompilation with explicit uncertainty.
- **Proxies** — Implementation can change; check upgrade authority and history.
- **Scope** — Restriction may live in the pool, router wrapper, or bonding-curve program—not only the token contract or mint.

## 2. EVM (Solidity / ERC-20) — common patterns

| Category | Examples to look for in code |
|----------|------------------------------|
| **Transfer gates** | `require` on `transfer` / `transferFrom` that fails for non-whitelisted or non-owner addresses |
| **Trading windows** | `tradingEnabled`, launch block, cooldowns that block sells early or for most holders |
| **Fees** | Excessive sell tax or dynamic tax to owner; max wallet or tx limits that prevent exiting |
| **Blacklists** | Lists blocking transfers from arbitrary addresses |
| **Approval traps** | Logic that burns or steals on `transferFrom` |
| **Hidden paths** | External calls in `_transfer` tied to router-only allowlists |

Automated scanners and Slither-style tools can help; false positives and negatives are common—manually read `_transfer` and any hooks.

## 3. Solana (SPL / Token-2022)

- **Authorities** — Mint and freeze authority; frozen ATAs cannot move funds.
- **Token-2022** — Transfer hooks, permanent delegate, pausable extensions—inspect on-chain mint layout and IDL when available.
- **Custom programs** — Launchpads and bonding curves wrap SPL transfers; review that program, not only the mint account.

## 4. Observational checks (no private keys)

- **Transaction history** — Ratio of successful sells versus buys from retail-like wallets (heuristic; wash trading exists).
- **Holders** — Extreme concentration plus few organic sell transactions may warrant suspicion—not proof.

## 5. Safe validation paths

- **Fork simulation** — Replay or simulate transfer and swap paths against historical state in a controlled environment; label outputs as simulation.
- **Testnet** — Only when the user controls deployment and understands limitations; mainnet can diverge after proxy upgrades.
- **Small mainnet tests** — Not a default recommendation; even small amounts can be lost to fees, traps, or malicious routers.

## 6. Reporting

- **Finding** — Mechanism (function, modifier, authority) plus code or account reference.
- **Confidence** — Static proof versus heuristic versus unknown bytecode.
- **User-facing takeaway** — When in doubt, avoid interaction; prefer audited interfaces and official router addresses.

## Ethical guardrails

- Educational only; not investment or legal advice.
- Do not provide weaponized instructions for scammers.
- False honeypot accusations harm projects with unusual but honest tokenomics—state uncertainty clearly.

**Goal:** Help users and researchers recognize sell-restriction patterns before committing funds, using evidence and safe methods.
