description: Routes to Chainalysis public Sanctions Screening surfaces—the free Sanctions REST API (address checks against OFAC SDN crypto listings) and the EVM on-chain oracle—plus how they differ from paid Chainalysis customer data. Use when the user references Chainalysis sanctions tooling, public.chainalysis.com, or repo notes in Chainalysis.md—not for legal conclusions, full vendor ToU reproduction, or substituting official government sanctions lists.

# Chainalysis — public sanctions screening (reference)

**Educational routing only.** This skill does **not** reproduce Chainalysis **Terms of Use**, **Privacy Policy**, or other legal text. For binding terms, rate limits, signup URLs, and contract addresses, use **Chainalysis’s current public documentation** and dashboards.

## What the public product family covers (high level)

| Surface | Role (conceptual) |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Sanctions API** | **REST** service: check whether a **cryptocurrency address** appears on **sanctions-related** listings Chainalysis exposes for this API (commonly described in relation to **OFAC SDN** crypto addresses). Authenticate with an **API key** (typically `X-API-Key` header). |
| **Oracle (EVM)** | **On-chain** smart contract aimed at dApps that need **in-protocol** screening—upstream docs describe a narrower scope than the API (e.g. **Ethereum/EVM** address checks vs API response shape). |

**Customers:** If you use paid Chainalysis products, upstream docs note you may receive **broader** identifications (e.g. **Chainalysis Identifications**, clustering beyond what the free public API exposes). Treat **customer** docs and contracts as authoritative for your org.

## Integration facts to verify live (do not trust stale copies)

- **No browser CORS:** Public docs state the API is **not** meant for direct **cross-origin** browser calls—use a **backend** or server-side caller.
- **Authentication:** Requests typically send `X-API-KEY` / `X-API-Key` (confirm header name in current docs).
- **Example host pattern** seen in public materials: `https://public.chainalysis.com/api/v1/address/<address>` — **paths and versions change**; copy from official docs before shipping.
- **Rate limits:** Documentation cites high-volume windows (e.g. thousands of requests per few minutes)—**confirm the current limit** in official docs; **429/403** handling belongs in your integration.
- **Support (public channel listed in materials):** `sanctions-api-support@chainalysis.com` — verify on the **live** support page.

## Local excerpt in this repository

The repo may include **`Chainalysis.md`** — a **local excerpt / scratch** of public-facing API and terms text. Use it only as a **convenience pointer**; **integration details** (endpoints, fields, legal terms) must match **current** Chainalysis publications.

## How to use with blockint

| Need | Skill |
|------|--------|
| Ethical investigation workflow, reporting, sanctions **process** context | **crypto-investigation-compliance** |
| Sanctions + risk tools via Range MCP (separate product) | **range-ai-investigation-playbook** |
| Risk indicator / exposure vocabulary (educational) | **risk-exposure-screening-concepts** |
| Address/transaction screening **workflow** concepts (educational) | **address-screening-workflow-concepts**, **transaction-screening-workflow-concepts** |
| AML / analytics platforms (vendor-neutral) | **blockchain-analytics-operations** |

## Guardrails

- **Sanctions compliance is legal and jurisdictional** — API output is **not** a substitute for **OFAC** / **EU** / **UN** lists, **licensed counsel**, or your institution’s **compliance program**.
- **Accuracy:** Vendor docs disclaim **guarantees** on timeliness and completeness—design **human review** and **primary-source** checks for material decisions.
- **Secrets:** Never commit or paste **API keys** or **internal** investigation exports into public repos or chats.
- **Prohibited use:** Respect Chainalysis **API Terms** (no scraping, no abuse, no competing “clone” of their product features—read the **live** terms).

**Goal:** a neutral blockint router for **Chainalysis public Sanctions Screening** surfaces and the optional **`Chainalysis.md`** excerpt, without mirroring vendor legal text or implying non-public product scope.
