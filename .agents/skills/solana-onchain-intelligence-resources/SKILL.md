# Solana on-chain intelligence — external resources

Use this skill together with **solana-tracing-specialist**, **solana-clustering-advanced**, **solana-defi-vulnerability-analyst-agent**, and **on-chain-investigator-agent**. It does not duplicate blockint methodologies; it routes agents to authoritative documentation indexes and products so they pull current API shapes and scopes from the source.

## Solana Foundation (developer skills and docs)

- **Agent skills hub:** [solana.com/SKILL.md](https://solana.com/SKILL.md) — install foundation-maintained skills (for example `npx skills add` from linked repos); categories include security checklist, testing, Kit/web3.js interop, payments, IDL clients.
- Use when building or auditing programs and clients; pair with **solana-defi-vulnerability-analyst-agent** for review posture.

## Sealevel Attacks (educational exploit / mitigation patterns)

- **Repository:** [coral-xyz/sealevel-attacks](https://github.com/coral-xyz/sealevel-attacks) — minimal **Anchor** programs demonstrating Solana-specific vulnerability patterns and fixes (defensive / learning use).
- **In bundle:** **sealevel-attacks-solana** — ethics and pairing with audit workflows.

## Neodyme Solana Security Workshop

- **Site:** [workshop.neodyme.io](https://workshop.neodyme.io/) — structured **levels**, **PoC framework**, and intentionally **vulnerable** example programs for learning offensive/defensive Solana program security ([Neodyme](https://neodyme.io/)).
- **Source:** [neodyme-labs/neodyme-breakpoint-workshop](https://github.com/neodyme-labs/neodyme-breakpoint-workshop) — **mdBook** (`docs/`, `mdbook serve`), **level0–level4** / **pocs**, Docker assets.
- **In bundle:** **neodyme-solana-security-workshop** — follow the workshop **Legal Notice**; not for copying vulnerable code into production.

## Osec — Solana auditor introduction (blog)

- **Article:** [Solana: An Auditor’s Introduction](https://osec.io/blog/2022-03-14-solana-security-intro) — [Otter Sec](https://osec.io/) (**osec.io**), **Mar 2022**: execution model, account metadata vs attacker-controlled inputs, native programs; complements Neodyme’s workshop (article cross-links it).
- **In bundle:** **osec-solana-auditor-introduction** — verify details against **current** Solana docs (runtime evolves).

## Helius (Solana infrastructure and docs index)

- **Documentation index:** [helius.dev/llms.txt](https://www.helius.dev/llms.txt) — discover blog and guides on RPC, DAS, webhooks, compression, MEV, Surfpool, congestion, and tooling.
- Typical investigation uses: enhanced RPC and history, parsed transactions, webhooks, Geyser-style streaming. Always confirm methods against current Helius docs for your plan and tier.

## Dune Sim and Dune Analytics (standalone skill)

- **Load the dedicated skill:** **dune-sim-onchain-analytics** — operational workflows (Sim vs SQL, EVM vs SVM, CUs, subscriptions, key safety), not duplicated here. Use Helius (above) for **RPC-native** Solana features; use **dune-sim-onchain-analytics** when building on Dune’s **Sim** and **Analytics API** surfaces.

## BlockchainSpider (open-source dataset collection)

- **Repository:** [github.com/wuzhy1ng/BlockchainSpider](https://github.com/wuzhy1ng/BlockchainSpider) — Python/Scrapy spiders for **block/transaction** ingestion and related flows; use **your own** JSON-RPC URLs and respect provider **ToS** / **rate limits**.
- **In bundle:** **blockchain-spider-toolkit** — safe command patterns and cross-links. Not a replacement for Helius or Range when you need **managed** APIs or **risk** products.

## Impersonator Solana (dApp dev / UI testing)

- **Repository:** [impersonator-eth/impersonator-solana](https://github.com/impersonator-eth/impersonator-solana) — connect to Solana dApps while presenting an **arbitrary address** for **read-only**-style exploration (no keys for that address—confirm behavior in upstream README).
- **Public site (per upstream):** [solana.impersonator.xyz](https://solana.impersonator.xyz)
- **In bundle:** **impersonator-dapp-devtools** — pairs with EVM [Impersonator](https://github.com/impersonator-eth/impersonator); **not** for phishing, fraud, or ToS abuse.

## Range AI (MCP blockchain intelligence)

- **Docs index:** [docs.range.org/llms.txt](https://docs.range.org/llms.txt) — browse Range AI pages.
- **MCP endpoint:** `https://api.range.org/ai/mcp` — connect in MCP-compatible clients for address intel, risk and sanctions-oriented tools, and cross-chain pivots (per Range product scope). Requires a user Range API key where applicable.
- **Investigation playbook (this bundle):** **range-ai-investigation-playbook** — step-by-step workflow (`get_address_risk`, `check_sanctions`, connections, transfers, funded-by, entities, cross-chain) and one-shot prompt template.

## Tavily (web search and research for OSINT)

- **Documentation index:** [docs.tavily.com/llms.txt](https://docs.tavily.com/llms.txt) — search, extract, crawl, map, research skills and CLI patterns.
- Use to corroborate public claims, find primary sources, or extract pages lawfully, alongside **bellingcat-investigation-toolkit** and **crypto-investigation-compliance**.

## PayAI Network (x402 and agent payments)

- **Documentation index:** [docs.payai.network/llms.txt](https://docs.payai.network/llms.txt) — x402 protocol, clients, servers, facilitators, supported networks.
- Relevant when designing paid API or agent pipelines on supported chains; not required for basic tracing alone.

## React Flow (fund-flow and graph UIs)

- **Documentation index:** [reactflow.dev/llms.txt](https://reactflow.dev/llms.txt) — node-based diagrams, layouts, accessibility.
- Use when building or specifying interactive wallet or transaction graph UIs. Data still comes from RPC and indexers, not from React Flow itself.

## Solana Policy Institute (policy and regulatory education)

- **Site:** [solanapolicyinstitute.org](https://www.solanapolicyinstitute.org/) — describes itself as a non-partisan, non-profit focused on educating policymakers on decentralized networks such as Solana and on legal clarity for people building and using them.
- **Content types (as presented on the site):** issue-area explainers (for example stablecoins, developer protections, tax clarity for staking), **newsroom** and **blog**, and a **legal archive** (filings, amicus briefs, comment and coalition letters).
- **Use in blockint:** background on **public** policy and **regulatory** narratives around Solana—not case law for a specific investigation. Pair with **crypto-investigation-compliance** when the user needs to separate **on-chain facts** from **legal** or **institutional** follow-up.
- **Not** legal advice; **not** a substitute for qualified counsel or official government guidance.

## How to combine with blockint

| Task | blockint skill | Often paired with |
|------|----------------|-------------------|
| Parse Solana txs, ATAs | **solana-tracing-specialist** | Helius (RPC/indexer docs); optional **Dune Sim** SVM ([docs.sim.dune.com/svm/overview.md](https://docs.sim.dune.com/svm/overview.md)) via **dune-sim-onchain-analytics** |
| Bulk slot/tx CSV pipelines (self-hosted) | **blockchain-spider-toolkit** | Authorized JSON-RPC provider |
| Cluster addresses, Jito | **solana-clustering-advanced** | Helius, on-chain data |
| Risk/sanctions screen | **crypto-investigation-compliance** | Range MCP (**range-ai-investigation-playbook**) |
| Web corroboration | **bellingcat-investigation-toolkit** | Tavily |
| Program security | **solana-defi-vulnerability-analyst-agent** | Solana Foundation skills, **osec-solana-auditor-introduction**, **sealevel-attacks-solana**, **neodyme-solana-security-workshop**, Helius/Surfpool for testing |
| Graph UI | — | React Flow |
| dApp UI as arbitrary address (dev/testing, ethics) | **impersonator-dapp-devtools** | [impersonator-solana](https://github.com/impersonator-eth/impersonator-solana) README |
| Solana policy / regulatory context (education) | **crypto-investigation-compliance** | Solana Policy Institute site |

## Ethical guardrails

- Third-party APIs (Helius, Range, Tavily) require user credentials where needed; respect terms of service and rate limits.
- Range and sanctions-style tools support compliance workflows; they do not replace legal conclusions.
- PayAI and x402 involve real payments; the user must configure keys and networks.

**Goal:** give one place to tie Solana on-chain intel work in blockint to the documentation indexes and products teams already use: Helius, Range, Tavily, PayAI, React Flow, Solana Foundation, Impersonator Solana (where relevant for dev/testing), Neodyme workshop / sealevel-attacks-style learning when relevant for program security, and the Solana Policy Institute for policy-facing context.
