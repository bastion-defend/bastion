description: "Points to the official Agent Skills open-format—agentskills/agentskills on GitHub, agentskills.io docs (including llms.txt index: Overview, What are skills?, Specification, Integrate skills into your agent). Use when the user asks how Agent Skills work, SKILL.md structure, integration, contributing, or aligning blockint skills with the upstream format—not as a substitute for reading the live specification and LICENSE terms in the upstream repo."

# Agent Skills — open format (reference)

**Educational routing only.** This skill does **not** reproduce the specification. Use the **canonical** links below for authoritative text, schema details, and license terms.

## Canonical URLs

| Resource | URL |
|----------|-----|
| **Repository** | [github.com/agentskills/agentskills](https://github.com/agentskills/agentskills) |
| **Site** | [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) — documentation hub (per upstream README) |

The upstream project describes **Agent Skills** as a simple, open format: folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that agents can discover for task-specific expertise (“write once, use everywhere”). The repo holds the **specification**, **documentation**, **reference SDK** material, and pointers to **example skills** and community channels (e.g. Discord — see live README).

## Documentation index ([llms.txt](https://agentskills.io/llms.txt))

Use **[agentskills.io/llms.txt](https://agentskills.io/llms.txt)** as the machine-readable **index** of first-party docs (discover pages before deep-linking). It currently lists:

| Doc | URL |
|-----|-----|
| **Overview** | [agentskills.io/home.md](https://agentskills.io/home.md) — open format for agent capabilities and expertise |
| **What are skills?** | [agentskills.io/what-are-skills.md](https://agentskills.io/what-are-skills.md) — lightweight format for specialized knowledge and workflows |
| **Specification** | [agentskills.io/specification.md](https://agentskills.io/specification.md) — complete format specification |
| **Integrate skills into your agent** | [agentskills.io/integrate-skills.md](https://agentskills.io/integrate-skills.md) — adding Agent Skills support to an agent or tool |

## What to read there

| Area | Typical use |
|------|----------------|
| **Specification** | [specification.md](https://agentskills.io/specification.md) — exact format expectations for portable skills |
| **Integration** | [integrate-skills.md](https://agentskills.io/integrate-skills.md) — agent/tool implementers |
| **Documentation** | [home.md](https://agentskills.io/home.md), [what-are-skills.md](https://agentskills.io/what-are-skills.md) — concepts |
| **Example skills** | Patterns and breadth (see GitHub README + examples) |
| **Contributing** | [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/agentskills/agentskills/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) in-repo |

## License (summary)

Upstream states: code in the repository is under **Apache-2.0**; documentation under **CC-BY-4.0** — confirm in-repo **LICENSE** and per-directory notices. The format is **community-open**; Anthropic is named as a maintainer in the public README.

## How to combine with blockint

| Need | Skill |
|------|--------|
| This repo’s BI / chain-focused skills | **blockchain-intelligence-playbook** |
| Portable skill format vs domain content | **agentskills-specification** (upstream spec); topical skills here for blockchain intel |

## Guardrails

- **Upstream wins** — If blockint layout ever diverges from the published spec, treat **agentskills** as the portability reference.  
- **No credential paste** — Spec work does not require embedding secrets in skills.

**Goal:** stable pointers to **[agentskills/agentskills](https://github.com/agentskills/agentskills)**, **[agentskills.io/llms.txt](https://agentskills.io/llms.txt)**, and **[agentskills.io/specification.md](https://agentskills.io/specification.md)** for **Agent Skills** format and documentation alignment.
