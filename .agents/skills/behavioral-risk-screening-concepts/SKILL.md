description: Educational map of behavioral risk screening—volume, velocity, and transit-style heuristics at address and transaction level. Use when the user asks about suspicious pattern detection, structuring-like activity, rapid fund movement, or AML-style behavior rules—not for tuning systems to evade monitoring or for legal conclusions.

# Behavioral risk screening (concepts)

**Educational reference only.** Heuristic alerts are **not** proof of crime. Investigate with **crypto-investigation-compliance**, **address-clustering-attribution**, and on-chain evidence. For **label-based** exposure (sanctions, scam tags), see **risk-exposure-screening-concepts**. Product specifics live in your vendor docs (**phalcon-compliance-documentation** where applicable).

## Behavioral Risk Engine (idea)

A **behavioral risk engine** flags **suspicious transaction patterns** using **statistics and rules** (thresholds, windows, frequencies) rather than—or in addition to—static address labels. Baselines may be **global**, **peer-group**, or **customer-specific**. False positives are common; triage before escalation.

## Address-level behavior (common templates)

Many compliance stacks offer **address-centric** rules similar to the following:

| Template | What it approximates | Notes |
|----------|----------------------|--------|
| **Large-value transfers** | Outbound or aggregate volume **far above** a typical-user or rolling baseline | Often uses USD notional at observation time; threshold is **configurable**. |
| **High-frequency transfers** | Many transfers in a **short window**, sometimes many **just below** a reporting or alert threshold (“structuring-like” pattern in traditional AML language) | Requires **count** and **time** bounds; may filter by asset. |
| **Transit / pass-through** | Address **receives** then **sends** most funds **quickly**, acting as an **intermediary** | Used as a **layering**-style signal; legitimate payment processors can resemble this—context matters. |

**Illustrative scenarios (hypothetical):**

- A wallet sends a **single** outbound transfer whose notional is **far above** the configured large-value threshold.  
- An address sends **fifteen** transfers of **just under** a chosen threshold within **24 hours**.  
- An address **receives** a large amount and **forwards** nearly all of it **within minutes** to other addresses.

Use **valid** chain identifiers in real work; examples here stay **generic** to avoid implying real flagged wallets.

## Transaction-level behavior (common templates)

At **single-transaction** granularity, platforms often add:

| Template | What it approximates | Notes |
|----------|----------------------|--------|
| **Large-value transfer** | Transfer **amount** exceeds a **user-defined** notional cap | May apply per asset, per corridor, or per counterparty class. |
| **Rapid transit** | Funds **leave** shortly after **arrival** along a monitored path (same tx chain or multi-hop within a **time** window) | “Rapid” is **policy-defined** (for example within **N** minutes). Overlaps with **transit** heuristics at graph level. |

**Illustrative scenario:** a transfer exceeds a **$100k** policy threshold, or value moves **A → B** within **five minutes** while policy treats **ten minutes** as the rapid-transit window.

## Relationship to exposure screening

| Engine style | Focus |
|--------------|--------|
| **Exposure** (see **risk-exposure-screening-concepts**) | **Who** the funds **touched**—labels, hops, taint-style exposure. |
| **Behavioral** (this skill) | **How** the address or tx **behaves**—size, speed, frequency, pass-through timing. |

Both may fire together; analysts should **reconcile** narratives and avoid double-counting the same fact pattern.

## Guardrails

- **Do not** assist with **structuring** advice to **evade** reporting thresholds or **gaming** monitoring rules.  
- **Do not** treat alerts as **adverse media** or **legal** findings without **case-level** review.  
- **Legitimate** businesses (payroll, market makers, bridges) can trigger **behavioral** rules—use **corroboration** and **off-chain** context when available.

**Goal:** shared vocabulary for **behavioral** AML-style pattern concepts aligned with common commercial monitoring templates, without binding any **specific** product configuration.
