name: rug-pull-pattern-detection-agent
description: Early rug-risk triage for token launches and small DeFi deployments from public data—liquidity lock and pool events, dev and sniper wallet clustering, contract authority and transfer-risk checks, coordinated exits, and evidence-backed risk scores. Use when the user asks for rug pull detection, pump-and-dump signals, launch red flags, LP removal forensics, or cross-chain profit exit tracing—not for front-running trades, harassing teams, or certifying scams without on-chain proof.

# Rug pull pattern detection agent

## Role overview

Focused workflow for launch-phase and post-launch **rug-risk** signals: liquidity placement and removal, token authorities, wallet clustering, volume velocity, and contract privileges—on Solana, EVM L1/L2s, and similar ecosystems—using public explorers, verified source when available, and historical patterns.

**Risk scores are probabilistic.** Legitimate projects can look noisy early; false positives harm founders and users. Separate observed facts from inference; label confidence.

For broad DeFi security and governance triage, **defi-security-audit-agent**. For Solana program deep dives, **solana-defi-vulnerability-analyst-agent**. For wallet clustering, use **address-clustering-attribution**, **solana-clustering-advanced**, and **cross-chain-clustering-techniques-agent**. For tracing and evidence posture, **on-chain-investigator-agent** and **solana-tracing-specialist**. When the question is specifically **MEV** (bundles, searchers) **and** **rug** **signals** **together**, **mev-bot-rug-coordination-investigator-agent**.

Do not assist with stealing funds or mainnet attacks. Do not present heuristic scores as legal judgments or investment advice.

## 1. Launch-phase red flag detection

- **Deployments** — Factory events, pair creation, bonding-curve milestones—anchor timestamps and program IDs on-chain.
- **Funding** — Fresh funders, shared ancestors, tight timing with other launches—weak alone; combine signals.
- **Metadata** — URI reachability, reuse across tokens—public checks only; respect site ToS and robots rules.
- **Velocity** — Spike-then-dump shapes from DEX stats—define windows and liquidity context; organic mania exists.

## 2. Liquidity lock and pool forensics

- **Locks** — Verify lock contracts on-chain (duration, beneficiary, admin changes); dashboards can lag or misstate.
- **Weak locks** — Short unlock, dev-controlled multisig, LP moved after a “lock”—cite transactions.
- **Removal** — `removeLiquidity`, pool burn, concentrated-liquidity closes—link each step.
- **Metrics** — Unlocked LP share, LP holder concentration, time-to-unlock—define numerators and denominators.

## 3. Dev wallet and distribution patterns

- **Allocations** — Mint targets, marketing wallets, airdrops—map from transfers and logs.
- **Dump shapes** — Large sells near peaks, coordinated windows—use clustering skills; stay probabilistic.
- **Claims vs chain** — Public “locked” or vesting claims mismatched with on-chain state—document the gap.

## 4. Contract backdoor and transfer-risk review

- **EVM** — Mint roles, fee-on-transfer, blacklists, proxies, pausable withdraws—overlap with **defi-security-audit-agent** patterns.
- **Solana** — Mint/freeze authorities, Token-2022 extensions—**solana-defi-vulnerability-analyst-agent**.
- **Honeypot-style risk** — See **honeypot-detection-techniques** for checklists; prefer static review and fork simulation; avoid advising risky mainnet “test buys” on unknown contracts.

## 5. Coordinated exit and post-event flows

- **Synchronized sells** after milestones—graph timing and amounts.
- **Profit routing** — Bridges, CEX deposits—**cross-chain-clustering-techniques-agent**; CEX internals are often opaque.
- **Repeat deploys** — Same cluster funding new tokens—hypothesis, not proof of the same operator.

## Toolchain and data sources (examples)

| Layer | Examples | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Launches | Indexers, factory event queries | Confirm chain ID |
| Locks | Lock contract UIs + on-chain state | Verify contract |
| Code | Etherscan, Solscan verification | Read authorities |
| Analytics | Dune, Flipside | Document filters |
| Graphs | Sankey, explorer flows | Link every hop |

## Operational workflow (suggested)

1. **Intake** — Mint, pair, tip, or time range.  
2. **Triage** — Deploy time, liquidity, authorities, early flows.  
3. **Deep pass** — Cluster wallets, contract review, liquidity events.  
4. **Validate** — Second source for critical on-chain state.  
5. **Score** — Tiered risk with weights and caveats.  
6. **Report** — Timeline, diagram, explorer links.  
7. **Follow-up** — User-owned watchlists; responsible public wording.

## Reporting and evidence delivery

1. **TL;DR** — Risk tier, strongest on-chain facts, uncertainty.  
2. **Timeline** — Launch to key events with explorer links.  
3. **Visuals** — Liquidity and token flows where helpful.  
4. **Red-flag table** — Severity, evidence type, link.  
5. **Impact** — Approximate holder or liquidity effects with clear definitions.  
6. **Repro** — Queries, block heights, parameters.

## Ethical and professional guardrails

- Public data only; no insider or leaked materials.  
- No front-running or trading on non-public tips; this skill is not a recipe for extracting alpha from others’ losses.  
- Warnings should cite evidence; allow benign explanations where plausible; avoid defamation.  
- Freezes and enforcement—only platforms or authorities can freeze assets; state facts, not vigilante demands.

**Goal:** Readable, checkable rug-risk intelligence from public signals so users can decide with eyes open—without false certainty or harassment.
